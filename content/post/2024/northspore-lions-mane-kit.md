## Introduction

Recently, I embarked on a fascinating journey of mushroom cultivation by purchasing the **Lion's Mane Mushroom Growing Kit** from [North Spore](https://northspore.com/collections/beginner-kits/products/grow-your-own-lions-mane).

## First Impressions

Upon arrival, I found the kit contained everything necessary for a novice grower to start immediately. The **clarity of the instructions** was exceptional, simplifying the setup process. The included spray bottle was perfect for a first-time mushroom grower.

## Quality and Experience

### Substrate and Mycelium Health

The **quality of the substrate** and the health of the mycelium were impressive. These factors almost guaranteed a successful and bountiful growth. The block was almost solid white, and it was clear it was ready for fruiting.

### Growing Process

Observing the development of Lion's Mane mushrooms was not only **educational but also immensely rewarding**. I did struggle with moisture issues as my house runs at 54% humidity and 72 degrees. The fruiting started without issue, but I had issues with it drying out. I purchased a monotub and put the box inside to help maintain moisture levels. Unfortunately, I was spraying water in via the air holes and managed to soak the Lion's Mane, causing it to yellow and get soft. I was able to harvest the first flush and did enjoy them after cutting off the yellow and soft parts. Unfortunately, I made the same mistake on flush two, and it was unsalvageable. I must note the instructions said to make a tent with a bag, but I thought I could outsmart it. I am now trying for a third flush after soaking the bag for 24 hours. Since the second flush aborted so soon, I am hoping there is enough energy left in the wood substrate for one more. I have also moved to using the [Hydroponic Humidifier with Hydroton](https://www.rabbithole223.com/post/mwgk-hydroponichumidifier-hydroton-updated/) from [Midwest Grow Kits](https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/)

## Suggested Improvement

### Moisture Control

While the kit is excellent, I noticed a challenge in maintaining consistent moisture levels. To further enhance this product, I recommend the inclusion of a **tent or moisture control system**. This would aid in keeping optimal humidity, ensuring even more consistent and fruitful growth.

## Conclusion

I wholeheartedly recommend the **Lion's Mane Mushroom Growing Kit** from North Spore for anyone interested in mushroom cultivation. It offers a **fun, educational, and rewarding experience**. With the addition of a moisture control tent, this kit has the potential to be the ideal choice for both beginners and seasoned growers.
