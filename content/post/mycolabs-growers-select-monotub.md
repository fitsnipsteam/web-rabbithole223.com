## Introduction

The [48-Quart Monotub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ71W7X2) from Myco Labs was my first monotub. This kit is nice, but I do have a few concerns.

## Ordering and Assembly

Ordered from Amazon, and it arrived promptly as usual. When it arrived, I had a look and was faced with a decision: to put the plugs in or the filters over the holes. Since I was using a [North Spore Organic Lion's Mane Mushroom Spray & Grow Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076VLY2V4), which was already starting to fruit, and I just needed to control moisture levels, I chose to use half the plugs and leave the other holes open, considering that while fruiting, there is not as much risk of contamination.

## Challenges and Considerations

I constantly feel that the mushrooms are not getting enough air exchange. My first flush of Lion's Mane turned out okay, but I ended up spraying the mushrooms directly while trying to keep the humidity up and had to harvest earlier than I wanted. Unfortunately, I didn't figure this out until after the second flush was also having the same yellowing and getting soft issue. To be 100 percent clear, I was using a fine mist sprayer through the holes and thought I was spraying it on the sides. Seems not, but hey, this is how we learn.

The 48-quart is much larger than I need for learning. Once I get better, it might make sense to use this larger kit.

## Suggested Improvements

The bottom pan is very deep at 5.5 inches, and then the lowest holes are 1.5 inches above that. This seems too deep to me, and I wonder if reducing the depth of the bottom pan might be advantageous. I would also like them to sell a spawning lid to go along with a fruiting lid. I am looking at growing some Pioppino (Cyclocybe aegerita) mushrooms and think it would be nice to have a spawning lid.

I also am choosing to use polyfil as it's easy to remove rather than the sticker filters that came with the monotub to allow options in the future.

## Summary

This is an okay design and may be useful once I get better at growing mushrooms. I do wish I would have gone with the smaller [Myco Labs Grower's Select 28Q Cube Mushroom Monotub Fruiting Chamber with Filter Disks and Liner](https://a.co/d/a7gEgxG) as that would be more manageable for a new and learning mushroom grower.
