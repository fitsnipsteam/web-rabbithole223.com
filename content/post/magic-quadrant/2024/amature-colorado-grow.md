# Intro

In this series, we send a total newbie a grow bag and a liquid culture syringe to embark on the captivating journey to explore the art of mushroom cultivation, specifically focusing on the Golden Teacher variety of mushrooms, known for its enlightening properties. We've order  an all-in-one grow bag and a liquid culture syringe from a known vendor to get started. 

Then sent this page and told him to read it and follow the instructions. This process, while straightforward, requires attention to detail, cleanliness, and patience.

## Ordering of All-In-One Bag and Golden Teacher Liquid Culture Syringe

Our first step was obtaining the necessary equipment.

The [all-in-one grow bag](https://www.etsy.com/listing/870858521/all-in-one-mushroom-grow-bag-mini) provides a sterile environment with a substrate and nutrients, ideal for beginners. Fully hydrated and sterilized with a five-micron filter patch and self-healing injection port. Simply inoculate the rye berry layer of the substrate with 3 cc of your favorite gourmet mushroom liquid culture solution.

A Golden Teacher syringe, filled with liquid culture (spores that have started to grow), is the key to starting your mycelium. We ordered these two parts and had them sent to our novice in Colorado. 

Good luck grower, we look forward to hearing how it went.

# Directions for our selected Novice 

## What we want back

A few images every time you work on this mushroom project and one or two sentence about the plrocess so far sent to us. Also reach out with questions, notes on the process, and any errors you might see in these instructions. 

## Cleanliness: 70 Percent Alcohol and Area Cleaning

Before beginning, ensure your workspace is immaculate. Use 70% alcohol to sterilize surfaces and tools. This step is crucial to prevent contamination that could jeopardize your grow.

## Inoculation: Liquid Culture Injection into All-In-One Bag

Inoculation is the process of introducing spores or liquid culture to the substrate. Use the needle and gloves provided with the syringe, and carefully screw on the capped needle to the syringe, making sure the needle is down tight. Then, take the protective cover off the needle and inject 3 cc into the grey self-healing injection port. This step marks the beginning of mycelial growth. Carefully put the cap back on the needle and store the rest of the syringe somewhere secure and safe.

## Spawn: Mycelium Growth

After inoculation, store the bag in a dark area between 70 and 85 degrees ideally. A bedroom closet in a box is usually a perfect location. Over the next few weeks, white mycelial networks will form, colonizing the substrate. This growth signifies a healthy start to your mushroom cultivation. You do not need to do anything during the next 7 days.

## Break and Shake

Once the mycelium has colonized about 30% of the bag, without opening the bag, gently break apart the mycelial clumps and shake the bag. This will usually be between 7 and 14 days, but depending on environmental factors, could be longer. This process distributes the mycelium, encouraging faster and more uniform growth throughout the substrate. Put back in the dark location for another 7 days.

## Starting Fruiting

When the substrate is fully colonized and covered in white mycelium, introduce the bag to conditions conducive to fruiting. This involves more light, fresh air, and a slight drop in temperature. For example, you could place the bag on a nightstand or dresser that gets indirect light. Once you start to see some very small mushrooms forming, you will want to cut open the very top 1 inch of the bag and use a spray bottle with water to lightly moisten the inside wall of the bag.

## Misting: The Bag, Not the Fruit

Humidity is crucial for mushroom development. Every few days, or when it looks dry, mist the inside of the bag to maintain high humidity, but avoid directly spraying the developing mushrooms to prevent damage.

## Veil Breaking and Harvest Time: Be Gentle, Pull from Block

Harvest the mushrooms after the veil beneath the cap starts to tear. The veil is right where the mushroom cap meets the stem. As the mushroom reaches maturity, the cap will pull away from the stem to achieve that classic mushroom look. Around



## Drying: In the Fridge and Oven

Post-harvest, drying the mushrooms is essential for preservation. Ideally, you would use a food dehydrator for 24 hours at 160°F, but if you do not have one, we can try another process. Start by placing them in a small clean paper bag in the fridge to reduce moisture content for 5 days, followed by placing on a cookie sheet at a very low 150°F on the rack farthest from the heat source to complete the drying process for 12 hours. Keep an eye on these.


## Consumption

While we do not suggest it, If you choose to eat your mushrooms most people start with 1/2 to 1 gram of the dried mushrooms and be prepared you might feel slight stomach discomfort, but people find it goes away with peppermint gum. If you prefer, you can make a tea that seems to be gentler on the stomach. Simply chop up the mushrooms and steep in water for 20 minutes, drink and enjoy. Effects last from 2 to 8 hours in most cases. 


# Conclusion

Stay tuned for Part 2, where we'll report on the progress of our novice grower. Remember, patience and attention to detail are your best allies in this rewarding journey.
