      <description>Introduction I love eating mushrooms of all kinds, funny I am the only one in my family who does. When I started watching a few online videos of mushroom growers. I live in Texas so even if I wanted to psilocybin is not a option. We weight the substrate as part of the product here and your life is over. I really enjoyed PhillyGoldenTeacher and therookiemycologistcontent and figured well all mushrooms should grow the same right?</description>
