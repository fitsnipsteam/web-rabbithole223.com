# Oregon Psilocybin 2024 Update: Navigating New Mushroom Laws and Program Insights

Oregon's landmark decision to legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use under Measure 109 has set a precedent for psychedelic therapy in the United States. As we navigate through 2024, significant updates to Oregon's mushroom laws have unfolded, presenting both advancements and challenges in the program's implementation. We are highly disturbed by the lack of inclusion of the right for small batch personal usage home growth and ask who stands to benefit most! As usual, big money is running the show, and you will need to have deep pockets to play.

## Financial Overhaul: Taxpayer Funding vs. Licensing Fees

The financial model of Oregon's psilocybin program, initially projected to be self-sustaining through licensing fees, encountered unforeseen challenges. With fewer licenses issued than anticipated, the program's reliance on taxpayer funds has sparked a debate on sustainability and the promises made to Oregonians.

## Psilocybin Services in Action: A Year in Review

Over 700 individuals have experienced psilocybin therapy in licensed service centers, highlighting the public's interest in alternative treatments. Centers like Chariot in Portland have become sanctuaries for those seeking therapeutic experiences, albeit with concerns over accessibility and costs.

## The Legal Landscape: Home Cultivation and Regulatory Hurdles

Despite the progress in therapeutic use, the personal cultivation of psilocybin mushrooms remains illegal, drawing parallels to the cannabis industry's early regulatory challenges. This restriction raises questions about accessibility and the program's inclusivity, and bows to big money investors having way too much input.

Oregon's journey with psilocybin is a testament to the state's progressive stance on mental health and alternative therapies but is marred by the focus on big money. As we move forward, the balance between regulation, accessibility, and sustainability will be crucial in shaping the future of psychedelic therapy in Oregon and beyond.
