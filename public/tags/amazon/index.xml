      <description>Introduction The 48-Quart Monotub from Myco Labs was my first monotub. This kit is nice, but I do have a few concerns.
Ordering and Assembly Ordered from Amazon, and it arrived promptly as usual. When it arrived, I had a look and was faced with a decision: to put the plugs in or the filters over the holes. Since I was using a North Spore Organic Lion&amp;rsquo;s Mane Mushroom Spray &amp;amp; Grow Kit, which was already starting to fruit, and I just needed to control moisture levels, I chose to use half the plugs and leave the other holes open, considering that while fruiting, there is not as much risk of contamination.</description>
