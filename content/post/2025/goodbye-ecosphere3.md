## Goodbye Ecosphere 3.0  

If you're serious about indoor growing, picking the right grow tent system is key to creating a controlled and efficient environment.  I started with the Ecosphere 3.0 from Midwest Grow Kit and it seemed good but over time it became clear it a was not a good fit. The plastic cover was very fragile and I was it separated at were the zipper connected to the plastic. On the third time replacing the cover I was fed up. The wire racks also turned out to be flimsy and a pain to deal with with the fragile plastic grow tent cover of the Ecosphere.

I have been using the [AC Infinity](https://amzn.to/3DENp2g) tent for about 8 months now to grow Lions Mane, Oyster, and other mushrooms and it has been a dream. Set in the corner of my office and forget for the most part. I fill my humidifier every other day, and with a auto light cycle I just have check on them once a week or so. 

## Ecosphere 3.0 by Midwest Grow Kits

### Overview
The Ecosphere 3.0 is an all-in-one grow tent kit, making it attractive for beginners. Unlike the CLOUDLAB 632, which is just the tent, the Ecosphere 3.0 includes everything you need to start growing immediately.  

This kit is targeted for mushroom cultivation, but really it a Martha grow tent like you can find on Amazon [Grow Tent](https://amzn.to/422IGka)

### Ecosphere Features

  Comes with a 4’ x 2’ x 6’ grow tent, lighting, humidifier, and a heater.

  Designed primarily for mushroom cultivation, but can be adapted for soil-based growing.

  Includes a filter patches to allow the system to maintain fresh airflow without contaminants.  
- Beginner-Friendly  
  No need to buy separate parts—just set up and start growing.  

## AC Infinity CLOUDLAB 632 Advanced Grow Tent  

### Overview  
The [AC Infinity CLOUDLAB 632](https://amzn.to/3DENp2g) is designed for growers who want high precision climate control and durability. For me the durability was the key, I did not want to be replacing the tent cover every few months. A VIVOSUN R4 4 Inch 190 CFM Inline Duct Ventilation Fan with Variable Speed Controller for Grow Tent I was using for a laser exhaust unit which addressed the airflow issue. [VIVOSUN R4](https://amzn.to/4bKNpdq). For filtration I have added [Merv 13 Material for Air Filters](https://amzn.to/3DtchtM) cut to cover then end of my [VIVOSUN 4 Inch 25 Feet Flex Air Aluminum Duct](https://amzn.to/43HQIjD) along with the rack, the [Mushroom Strip Light Complete Set COB LED](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/mushroom-strip-light-complete-set-cob-led-16-4-ft.aspx), and heaters from the Ecosphere kit.


### CLOUDLAB Features  
- Thick 2000D Canvas  
  The tent is made from tear-resistant Oxford fabric with a highly reflective diamond mylar interior to maximize light efficiency. This stuff is amazing and tough, I have not had to replace. 
- Strong Steel Frame  
  The 22mm-thick steel poles provide extra durability and can handle heavy lights and equipment.  
- Dual Ventilation Ports  
  Pre-cut ventilation holes make it easy to set up my exhaust fan and duct hose.
- Spacious Interior  
  The 4’ x 2’ x 6’ size holds the rack just fine. 


## Starting Fresh

If I was starting without the Ecosphere my build would look like this. I am not sure what to do to replace the heater that comes with the Ecosphere but I have not really need it. The CLOUDLINE PRO T6 amd hose drives up the cost but I was using it in the Ecosphere also so for me its not really an additional cost.
