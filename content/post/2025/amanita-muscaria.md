Psychedelic chocolate bars are all the rage, but not all of them contain psilocybin. A new trend has emerged: **Amanita muscaria-infused chocolates**, sold over the counter in the U.S. as a legal way to alter consciousness.  

Unlike *Psilocybe* mushrooms, *Amanita muscaria* doesn’t contain psilocybin or psilocin. Instead, its psychoactive compounds—**muscimol** and **ibotenic acid**—produce a very different effect. While psilocybin mushrooms are known for their mind-expanding, hallucinogenic trips, *Amanita muscaria* leans more towards a sedative, dreamlike state.  

So, do these mushroom chocolates actually work, or are they just a marketing gimmick? Let’s break it down.

## **What Is *Amanita Muscaria*?**  

You’ve probably seen *Amanita muscaria* before—it’s the iconic red-and-white mushroom from fairy tales and video games. But beyond its whimsical appearance, it’s been used for centuries in shamanic rituals, particularly in Siberia and Northern Europe.  

The effects of *Amanita muscaria* come from two primary compounds:  

- **Ibotenic acid** – The raw form, which is neurotoxic in large doses but converts to muscimol when properly prepared.  
- **Muscimol** – The main psychoactive component, responsible for its hypnotic and dissociative effects.  

When dried and processed correctly, *Amanita muscaria* produces an altered state that can include euphoria, relaxation, vivid dreams, and occasional delirium.

## **Amanita Muscaria vs. Psilocybin Mushrooms**  

While both mushrooms can alter perception, their experiences are fundamentally different.  

| Feature            | *Amanita Muscaria*              | Psilocybin Mushrooms (*Psilocybe* species) |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Compounds** | Muscimol, Ibotenic Acid        | Psilocybin, Psilocin                     |
| **Effects**       | Sedative, dreamlike, dissociative | Hallucinogenic, introspective, psychedelic |
| **Duration**     | 4-10 hours                        | 4-6 hours                                |
| **Onset**        | 30-90 minutes                    | 20-40 minutes                            |
| **Legal Status (U.S.)** | Uncontrolled (legal in most states) | Schedule I (illegal federally)          |

While psilocybin mushrooms open up deep, introspective, and sometimes highly visual trips, *Amanita muscaria* feels more like a weird, dreamy in-between state—sometimes relaxing, sometimes confusing, and definitely unpredictable.

## **The Rise of Amanita Muscaria Chocolate Bars**  

Companies have started packaging *Amanita muscaria* extracts into **chocolate bars**, gummies, and other edibles, marketing them as a legal alternative to psilocybin. The idea is simple: mix processed *Amanita muscaria* extract into an easy-to-dose, tasty format.  

But do they actually work?  

### **What Users Report**  

Experiences vary, but common reports include:  

✅ **Deep relaxation** – Many say it feels like a mild sedative, great for winding down.  
✅ **Vivid dreams** – Some users experience lucid or extremely detailed dreams.  
✅ **Body high** – A warm, tingly sensation similar to a light cannabis edible.  
❌ **Confusion & nausea** – Improper dosing or poor preparation can lead to grogginess or an uncomfortable body load.  
❌ **Unpredictable effects** – While some feel euphoric and dreamy, others report disorientation or even mild delirium.  

The biggest issue? **Inconsistent potency.** Unlike psilocybin, where doses can be fairly standardized, *Amanita muscaria* chocolates often lack precise measurements of muscimol content, leading to mixed results.

## **Are These Chocolates Worth Trying?**  

If you’re expecting a **psilocybin-like trip**, you’ll be disappointed. *Amanita muscaria* chocolates won’t send you into a full-blown psychedelic experience, but they **can** provide a dreamy, mildly altered state.  

✅ **Good for:** Relaxation, dream enhancement, exploring legal psychoactives.  
❌ **Not great for:** Classic psychedelic visuals, deep introspection, strong euphoria.  

### **Final Thoughts**  

*Amanita muscaria* chocolates are an intriguing legal alternative, but they’re not a true replacement for psilocybin. If you’re curious about altered states and dreamlike consciousness shifts, they’re worth a shot—but manage your expectations.
