			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ71W7X2">48-Quart Monotub</a> from Myco Labs was my first monotub. This kit is nice, but I do have a few concerns.</p>
<h2 id="ordering-and-assembly">Ordering and Assembly</h2>
<p>Ordered from Amazon, and it arrived promptly as usual. When it arrived, I had a look and was faced with a decision: to put the plugs in or the filters over the holes. Since I was using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076VLY2V4">North Spore Organic Lion&rsquo;s Mane Mushroom Spray &amp; Grow Kit</a>, which was already starting to fruit, and I just needed to control moisture levels, I chose to use half the plugs and leave the other holes open, considering that while fruiting, there is not as much risk of contamination.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-considerations">Challenges and Considerations</h2>
<p>I constantly feel that the mushrooms are not getting enough air exchange. My first flush of Lion&rsquo;s Mane turned out okay, but I ended up spraying the mushrooms directly while trying to keep the humidity up and had to harvest earlier than I wanted. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t figure this out until after the second flush was also having the same yellowing and getting soft issue. To be 100 percent clear, I was using a fine mist sprayer through the holes and thought I was spraying it on the sides. Seems not, but hey, this is how we learn.</p>
<p>The 48-quart is much larger than I need for learning. Once I get better, it might make sense to use this larger kit.</p>
<h2 id="suggested-improvements">Suggested Improvements</h2>
<p>The bottom pan is very deep at 5.5 inches, and then the lowest holes are 1.5 inches above that. This seems too deep to me, and I wonder if reducing the depth of the bottom pan might be advantageous. I would also like them to sell a spawning lid to go along with a fruiting lid. I am looking at growing some Pioppino (Cyclocybe aegerita) mushrooms and think it would be nice to have a spawning lid.</p>
<p>I also am choosing to use polyfil as it&rsquo;s easy to remove rather than the sticker filters that came with the monotub to allow options in the future.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This is an okay design and may be useful once I get better at growing mushrooms. I do wish I would have gone with the smaller <a href="https://a.co/d/a7gEgxG">Myco Labs Grower&rsquo;s Select 28Q Cube Mushroom Monotub Fruiting Chamber with Filter Disks and Liner</a> as that would be more manageable for a new and learning mushroom grower.</p>
