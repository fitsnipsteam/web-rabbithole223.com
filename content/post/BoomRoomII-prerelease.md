In this pre-review article, we'll delve into the key features that make this kit stand out and explore how it could elevate your mushroom cultivation game.

## The Allure of the BoomRoom II

Northspore is set to launch the BoomRoom II, a comprehensive solution for at-home mushroom cultivation. One of the standout features is the default 5 shelf tent, offering a whopping 18 cubic ft. of growing space. This design promises to allow cultivators to grow up to 9 times more mushrooms than with traditional monotubs, making it an appealing option for those looking to maximize their yields.

## Key System Features

Let's take a closer look at the key system features that make the BoomRoom II a promising choice for mycologists:

### Efficient Fresh Air Exchange

The inclusion of a highly efficient fresh air exchange fan is crucial. Not only does it prevent CO2 build-up, but it also promotes optimal air flow, enabling users to establish a positive or negative pressure system tailored to their specific needs.

### Myco-Mister II for Improved Quality

The Myco-Mister II, equipped with three transducer plates, generates an ultra-fine mist. This innovative feature aims to enhance mushroom quality and reduce the risk of blotch and other diseases, promising a healthier and more bountiful harvest.

### External Controls for Space Optimization

The BoomRoom II's design places humidity and fresh air controls on the outside of the tent, maximizing the interior space for optimal mushroom growth. The flexible tent design allows users to position controls on either side, adapting to the unique requirements of their growing space.

### Durable Construction and Spore Floor Protection

Crafted with an ultra-durable clear vinyl tent, reinforced woven siding, and a sub-floor layer, the BoomRoom II provides a waterproof and robust enclosure for cultivating mushrooms. The custom 'Spore Floor' adds an extra layer of protection beneath key components, ensuring the longevity of your cultivation setup.

### Convenient Controller Loops 

The BoomRoom II takes convenience to the next level with three built-in loops, allowing users to effortlessly hang humidity and fan controllers directly on the tent for easy access and monitoring. This thoughtful design eliminates the need for cumbersome alternatives like zipties and random holes in the tent surface, addressing a common concern faced by growers using other kits such as the Midwest Grow Kits Ecosphere 3.0.


# Conclusion

As we eagerly anticipate the release of the BoomRoom II Automated Martha Tent Mushroom Grow Kit from Northspore, the outlined features suggest a promising solution for home mushroom cultivation. From efficient air exchange to cutting-edge misting technology, this kit appears to address the key elements necessary for successful and high-yield mushroom cultivation.
