When diving into the fascinating world of home mushroom cultivation, there's always a lingering worry what happens if my grow bags fail to colonize? Are bag replacements from suppliers actually a thing, or just wishful thinking? I recently had a chance to put this very question to the test with **Zombie MyCo** and thought I'd share my experience.

## My Initial Encounter with Zombie MyCo

Earlier this year, eager to experiment, I ordered two **All in One Mushroom Grow Bags** from [Zombie MyCo](https://zombiemyco.com). Due to unforeseen delays, my bags sat patiently for about three weeks before inoculation, stored carefully in their original box in a cool, dark place. When I finally got around to inoculating them, I encountered something completely unexpected: **nothing happened**.

My first instinct was to double check everything had I mishandled something? Interestingly, I had used two entirely different liquid cultures on the two separate bags, significantly reducing the likelihood that the cultures themselves were the problem.

## Zombie MyCo’s Customer Service Response

Feeling slightly frustrated and perplexed, I reached out to Zombie MyCo's customer support team. My goal wasn’t initially to get replacements I genuinely wanted to troubleshoot what had gone wrong. Zombie MyCo responded swiftly, reassuring me they hadn't encountered similar issues recently but reminding me they offer a bag guarantee.

For about a week, we exchanged emails, carefully going over the details of my process and the timeline. Admittedly, their questions were reasonable and thoughtful, aiming to help me understand what could've possibly gone wrong. At this point, I was prepared to simply write off the experience as "one of those things" and move on.

## A Pleasant Surprise: Replacement Bags Arrive

Just when I was ready to let things go, Zombie MyCo surprised me. They graciously offered and then promptly sent two brand new replacement grow bags an unexpected gesture of genuine customer care.

Now, here's the best part: these replacement bags have been nothing short of amazing! Colonization kicked off promptly, and I am currently enjoying healthy growth, anticipating an abundant and exciting flush soon.

## Final Thoughts: Zombie MyCo is Legit!

For anyone still hesitant about grow bag guarantees or skeptical about supplier promises, let me say this clearly: **Zombie MyCo is legit**. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and willingness to stand behind their products has truly impressed me.

I felt it was important to share this personal experience openly, as finding a reliable supplier you can trust makes all the difference in mushroom cultivation. If you've ever doubted whether bag replacements are real, rest assured Zombie MyCo stands by their products and their customers.

Happy growing!
