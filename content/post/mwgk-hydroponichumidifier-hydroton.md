# Introduction

As an mushroom cultivator, I recently invested in a Hydroponic Humidifier System designed explicitly for maintaining optimal humidity levels during the growth process. Excited about the potential improvements in my monotub cultivation, I aimed to cotrol the humidity control for a more efficient and productive mushroom-growing environment for my Lions Mane mushroom kit from North Spore.

# Product Details

The hydroponic humidifier system includes essential components for a comprehensive setup:

- **Aqua-Air Pro 2.5w High Power Air Pump:**
  - Ultra-quiet operation for minimal disturbance.
  - Consistent and reliable air supply to the hydroponic humidifier.

- **Hydroponic Humidifier with Hydroton & Synthetic Fibers:**
  - Engineered for mushroom cultivation, promising optimal moisture levels without over-saturation.
  - Utilizes Hydroton and synthetic fibers for efficient humidity distribution.

- **Blue Silicone Air Hose with Built-in HEPA Filter:**
  - 10mm output hose for precise and directed delivery of humid air.
  - Integrated HEPA filter to prevent airborne contaminants.

# Initial Expectations

With the system running on a schedule of 1 hour on and 5 hours off, I anticipated a the least a mild improvement in humidity levels. I figured I would have to adjust the amount of time on / off, soi this was just a starting point.

# Real-World Experience

Unfortunately, after implementing the hydroponic humidifier system in my monotub, I observed minimal changes in humidity levels. Despite following the recommended schedule, the expected impact on moisture within the growing environment was not evident. Regrettably, the initial results have left me questioning the effectiveness of the hydroponic humidifier system. As of now, I cannot confidently assert that it was a good purchase, as it has not delivered the expected improvement in moisture control for my mushroom cultivation.

# Challenges Encountered

- **Ineffectiveness of On/Off Cycle:**
  - The 1-hour on and 5-hour off cycle did not seem to make a noticeable difference in my monotub's humidity levels as monitored by two separate hydrometers. The first a  Govee Hygrometer Thermometer H5075 https://a.co/d/0fZXWwV and the second a small "Mini Hygrometer Indoor Humidity Meter Hygrometer Thermometer" https://a.co/d/iXlPuyP, both models matched within 1%. 

# Seeking Solutions

If anyone has advice, guidance, or insights on potential improvements or adjustments, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts. It's possible that there might be specific nuances in my setup or operation that need attention, and I am open to exploring any recommendations to make the most of this hydroponic humidifier system.

# Conclusion

While the hydroponic humidifier system holds promise, my current experience raises concerns about its practical effectiveness in my specific cultivation scenario. I remain optimistic that with adjustments and shared insights from the community, this system can live up to its potential and contribute significantly to a more successful and efficient mushroom cultivation journey.
