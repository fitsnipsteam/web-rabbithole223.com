      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;goodbye-ecosphere-30&#34;&gt;Goodbye Ecosphere 3.0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about indoor growing, picking the right grow tent system is key to creating a controlled and efficient environment.  I started with the Ecosphere 3.0 from Midwest Grow Kit and it seemed good but over time it became clear it a was not a good fit. The plastic cover was very fragile and I was it separated at were the zipper connected to the plastic. On the third time replacing the cover I was fed up. The wire racks also turned out to be flimsy and a pain to deal with with the fragile plastic grow tent cover of the Ecosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3UmBLyY&#34;&gt;48-Quart Monotub&lt;/a&gt; from Myco Labs was my first monotub. This kit is nice, but I do have a few concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-and-assembly&#34;&gt;Ordering and Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ordered from Amazon, and it arrived promptly as usual. When it arrived, I had a look and was faced with a decision: to put the plugs in or the filters over the holes. Since I was using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Oo3zyU&#34;&gt;North Spore Organic Lion&amp;rsquo;s Mane Mushroom Spray &amp;amp; Grow Kit&lt;/a&gt;, which was already starting to fruit, and I just needed to control moisture levels, I chose to use half the plugs and leave the other holes open, considering that while fruiting, there is not as much risk of contamination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As expected it was moslty user error. I am not going to cover the product details here again but you can ready my orginal review &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rabbithole223.com/post/mwgk-hydroponichumidifier-hydroton/&#34;&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt; and get all that fun info.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;initial-expectations&#34;&gt;Initial Expectations&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To restate my orginal expections, With the system running on a schedule of 1 hour on and 5 hours off, I anticipated a the least a mild improvement in humidity levels. I figured I would have to adjust the amount of time on / off, soi this was just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2024-03-01 Update with &lt;a href=&#34;https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/&#34;&gt;Midwest Grow Kits&lt;/a&gt; Affilate links.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Embarking on a journey into home mushroom cultivation, we opted for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/Ecosphere&#34;&gt;Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0&lt;/a&gt; from Midwest Grow Kits. Our experience with this system has been a mix of highs and lows, and here we are offering insights into its assembly, additional accessories, and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-and-assembly&#34;&gt;Ordering and Assembly&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The initial process of purchasing the Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0 was straightforward and efficient. The package arrived promptly, and the assembly was relatively easy. We opted to enhance the system with the addition of the 5th shelf, a decision that later proved to be a mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
