## Introduction

Agar agar, a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed, is an essential tool for amateur mycologists. Its unique properties make it an ideal medium for cultivating fungi. This article provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to make agar agar at home using a simple recipe that combines potato flakes, agar agar, and light corn syrup.

## Ingredients

3:2:1 ratio of ingredients

- 12g parts potato flakes 
- 8g parts agar agar powder
- 4g part light corn syrup
- 400ml Water

## Equipment

- Ketchup cups or similar small containers
- Scale that handles grams
- Medium-sized saucepan
- Quart jar to hold the Agar while it pressure cooks
- Measuring cup and spoons
- Spoon for stiring
- Presure Pot, large enough to hold your jar

## Procedure

Prepare the Mixture: In a medium-sized saucepan, mix the potato flakes and agar agar powder. Add enough water to create a smooth, pourable mixture. Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure no lumps are present.

Add the Corn Syrup: Once the mixture is smooth, add the light corn syrup. Stir continuously while slowly heating the mixture. The corn syrup acts as a carbohydrate source, crucial for fungal growth.

Heat the Mixture: Heat the mixture over a medium flame. Keep stirring to prevent the mixture from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring it to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens slightly.

Cooling and Pouring: After the mixture has thickened, remove it from the heat. Allow it to cool slightly, but not completely – the mixture should be warm but not hot.

Put your jar with a loose lid and the top covered with foild into the pressure cooker and cook at 15psi for 30 minutes. Allow your presure cooler to cool down, follow the instructions with your pressure cooker until its safe to open. You will want to get the agar in the jar down to 160F and then poor into the cups. Ideally you do the pour in a still air box, but I had to use the oven tek. A open oven, heated to 250F, and a rack over the opening where the heat rises. 


Carefully pour the mixture into ketchup cups, filling them up to two-thirds of their capacity.

Solidifying the Agar: Allow the agar in the ketchup cups to cool at room temperature. As it cools, it will solidify into a gel-like consistency. Ensure the agar is completely solidified before using it for mycological purposes.
Storage: Once solidified, the agar can be covered with lids or plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator. This prevents contamination and preserves the agar for future use.

This simple, effective recipe is ideal for amateur mycologists looking to create their own agar medium at home. By following these steps, you can prepare a reliable and cost-effective growth medium for your mycological experiments.
