      <description>Failed Lions Mane growth I have run two flushes with the North Spore Lions Mane in a box and the first fruited and I was able to eat but I really felt it should have went longer. The second flush is less prommising it grew but then I seemed to over wet it and it started to go yellow and got really soft, it sadly went to the trash.
