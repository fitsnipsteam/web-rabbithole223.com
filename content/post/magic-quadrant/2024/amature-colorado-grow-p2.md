# Recap

In the [initial installment](/post/magic-quadrant/2024/amature-colorado-grow/) of this series, we equipped a complete beginner with a grow bag and a spore syringe to begin an exciting venture into mushroom cultivation, focusing on the Golden Teacher strain, celebrated for its profound insights. We procured a user-friendly all-in-one grow bag and a Golden Teacher spore syringe from a reputable supplier to kickstart this journey. 

We provided this novice with our guide, emphasizing the importance of precision, cleanliness, and patience throughout the cultivation process.

# Arrival of Materials

The cultivation kit, including the grow bag and spore syringe, was successfully delivered on February 15, 2024, all set for commencement.

# Inoculation Process

On February 16, the bag was inoculated with 5cc of the spore solution, slightly more than our original instructions suggested, possibly adhering to the grow bag's own guidelines. Subsequently, the bag was stored in a dark, secluded space to encourage mycelial development.

### Update on February 21

The cultivator reported initial signs of mycelial growth, which, although not clearly visible in the provided photograph, was encouraging news.
