			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Embarking on a journey into home mushroom cultivation, we opted for the <a href="https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/the-mushroom-ecosphere-3-0.aspx">Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0</a> from Midwest Grow Kits. Our experience with this system has been a mix of highs and lows, and here we are offering insights into its assembly, additional accessories, and functionality.</p>
<h2 id="ordering-and-assembly">Ordering and Assembly</h2>
<p>The initial process of purchasing the Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0 was straightforward and efficient. The package arrived promptly, and the assembly was relatively easy. We opted to enhance the system with the addition of the 5th shelf, a decision that later proved to be a mixed bag.</p>
<h2 id="accessory-choices">Accessory Choices</h2>
<p>Regrettably, we chose to invest in the 5th shelf over the <a href="https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/heavy-duty-condensation-drip-tray-for-ecosphere-greenhouses.aspx">Heavy Duty Condensation Drip Tray</a>, an oversight that led to a lesson learned. Upon realizing the importance of the drip tray, we promptly ordered it separately, and it arrived promptly, rectifying the oversight. In hindsight, it would have been wiser to prioritize the drip tray initially.</p>
<h2 id="digital-humidity-controller">Digital Humidity Controller</h2>
<p>One wise investment we made was the <a href="https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/digital-humidity-controller-for-high-humidity-environments.aspx">Digital Humidity Controller for High Humidity Environments</a>, priced at $29.99. This addition has proven to be a valuable asset in maintaining optimal humidity levels within the Ecosphere. However, we encountered some challenges related to its setup due to its short cords.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-and-considerations">Challenges and Considerations</h2>
<p>The primary issue we faced was the short cords of both the humidity and temperature controllers. This made the setup process cumbersome and limited the placement options within the growing environment. A notable inconvenience arose from the requirement to keep the humidifier hose pointing upwards at all times, but this is true with all ultrasonic humidifiers. Any deviation from this position resulted in a failure to release humidity. This limitation calls for careful consideration during setup and might benefit from a more flexible design in future iterations. Really I dont understand why the cords are all so short as it just makes everything harder to setup and has been the most frustrating part so far.</p>
<h2 id="suggested-improvements">Suggested Improvements</h2>
<p>Inclusion of longer cords for both controllers, providing users with more flexibility in arranging their setup. Additionally, exploring the feasibility of a shorter humidifier that could be placed inside the tent might alleviate the current challenges associated with hose positioning.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-product-table">Amazon Product Table</h2>
<p>I wanted to see how much this kit would cost on Amazon, and while not a perfect match it does include all the needed parts but the custom light socket with pan and switch.</p>
<p>The rest of the list:</p>

<h2 id="total-cost">Total Cost</h2>
<p>The total cost of the additional accessories is ${{ 14.99 + 6.99 + 34.99 + 16.99 + 8.99 + 18.99 + 22.47 + 34.99 + 14.99 }}.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I dont regret the purchase at this point, for the price I think the kit is well put together and I doubt you could do much better. That said once you udnerstand the setup I think you could tune it to your needs and end up with a custom fit just for you at near the same price. Would buy for a person new to mushrooms but you might outgrow parts of this system.</p>
