## Introduction


I love eating mushrooms of all kinds, funny I am the only one in my family who does. When I started watching a few online videos of mushroom growers. I live in Texas so even if I wanted to psilocybin is not a option. We weight the substrate as part of the product here and your life is over. I really enjoyed [PhillyGoldenTeacher](https://www.youtube.com/@PhillyGoldenTeacher) and [therookiemycologist](https://www.youtube.com/@therookiemycologist)content and figured well all mushrooms should grow the same right? That's my first error!


## First Attempt


I ordered the North Spore [Lions Mane Mushroom grow kit from Amazon](https://amzn.to/4bnkKuG). In a few days I had some little white puff balls growin on the counter, the kids are involved and everything is perfect. They spray the box in the morning before school and then when they get home. Then it goes sideways. The Lions Mane looks spindly and not right.

After a lot of trial and error I finally figured out I had a moisture problem. Once I fixed that it was better but never fully recovered. This was not enough to make me stop though, I was going to grow a darn mushroom or well dammit I just was.




## Second Attempt


After that minor failure where I did get some Lions Mane fruit, I went on a path to fix it all. I picked up a [48-Quart Monotub](https://amzn.to/3UmBLyY) from Amazon, and tried to put the North Spore kit in there to keep the moisture high, and ended up with a bad oxygen exchange. During this time I had already decided I was going to grow mushrooms and started my third wave.


## Third Wave


I went to [Mid West Grow Kits](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com) and filled my basket. Picked up a [Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/the-mushroom-ecosphere-3-0.aspx) [Read my review](https://www.rabbithole223.com/post/2024/ecosphere3-base/) with the fifth shelf, five [Four random one Pink Oyster Grow Kit Specials](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/ready-to-grow-gourmet-mushroom-kit-5lbs-your-choice.aspx), Polyfil Synthetic Fibers (One Quart), Coco Coir Brick Gro-Med 5kg Premium Organic 10 Pound Coir Block, Digital Humidity Controller for High Humidity Environments, The Mushroom Humidity Dome (love this), and about 10 other products spending just over 1k! I was going to start a mushroom growing business.


The rack gets here, I build it, no problem then I realized that it would be really ideal to use the Heavy Duty Condensation Drip Tray For Ecosphere Greenhouses, and ofcourse while I was there pick up a few other items to save on shipping. There goes another $250.


OK I am ready to run my gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, I am going to hit the farmers market and make that money back in a month. Well turns out half the stuff I purchased is not good for growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms! That 5kg Coir block, not so useful for Lions Mane.


Next thing I know the Pink Oysters and King Trumpet mushrooms are fruiting in the bag in my closet. OK no big deal, throw them in the tent and fruit them. Twenty four hours later I think the Pioppinos and Shiitakes are ready (I was wrong) so throw them in the Ecosphere Martha tent, but wait these are not really compatible env mushrooms. Then the Lions Mane fruits in the bag in my closet! I had planned on rolling these out slowly but I guess they had other plans and nature does not give a hoot about my plans.


The Pink Oysters and Lions Mane are doing great, the King Trumpets are small but maybe will recover. Then we have the other two which I put in way too early.


# My suggestion


Buy one Grow Kit and run its full path, two maybe three fruits. If you like it, master that one mushroom. Do two or three grows your second time, grow them in a large plastic tub, mist it a few times a day and build from there. Maybe learn about [making your own agar](https://youtu.be/F0z-LwC_qNo) and cloning to save money. All in one bags for the type of mushrooms your going to grow. Get a single syringe and inoculate them, break and shake, fruit them in your little tube. Go cheap, if your making agar buy the cheap [ Telephone Brand Agar Agar Powder 25 g.x2 Pack ](https://amzn.to/48YjEDS), if you want to make bulk liquid culture get the cheap [2000 RPM Magnetic Stir Plate](https://amzn.to/3SJx5SE) you don't need the best out the door. If your still doing this in a year you can upgrade but it's more work than you think.
