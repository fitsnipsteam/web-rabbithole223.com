## Goodbye Ecosphere 3.0  

If you're serious about indoor growing, picking the right grow tent system is key to creating a controlled and efficient environment. I started with the Ecosphere 3.0 from Midwest Grow Kit, and it seemed good, but over time it became clear that it was not a good fit. The plastic cover was very fragile, and I saw it separate at the points where the zipper connected to the plastic. After replacing the cover for the third time, I was fed up. The wire racks also turned out to be flimsy and a pain to deal with, especially with the fragile plastic grow tent cover of the Ecosphere.

I have been using the [AC Infinity](https://amzn.to/3DENp2g) tent for about eight months now to grow Lion’s Mane, Oyster, and other mushrooms, and it has been a dream. I set it in the corner of my office and mostly forget about it. I fill my humidifier every other day, and with an automatic light cycle, I only have to check on them once a week or so. 

## Ecosphere 3.0 by Midwest Grow Kits

### Overview  
The Ecosphere 3.0 is an all-in-one grow tent kit, making it attractive for beginners. Unlike the CLOUDLAB 632, which is just the tent, the Ecosphere 3.0 includes everything you need to start growing immediately.  

This kit is targeted at mushroom cultivation, but really, it is a Martha grow tent like you can find on Amazon [Grow Tent](https://amzn.to/422IGka).

### Ecosphere Features  
- **Complete Grow Kit**  
  Comes with a 4’ x 2’ x 6’ grow tent, lighting, humidifier, and heater.  
- **Dual Use for Mushrooms & Plants**  
  Designed primarily for mushroom cultivation but can be adapted for soil-based growing.  
- **Pre-Installed Ventilation System**  
  Includes filter patches to allow the system to maintain fresh airflow without contaminants.  
- **Beginner-Friendly**  
  No need to buy separate parts—just set up and start growing.  

## AC Infinity CLOUDLAB 632 Advanced Grow Tent  

### Overview  
The [AC Infinity CLOUDLAB 632](https://amzn.to/3DENp2g) is designed for growers who want high-precision climate control and durability. For me, durability was the key—I did not want to be replacing the tent cover every few months. A VIVOSUN R4 4-Inch 190 CFM Inline Duct Ventilation Fan with Variable Speed Controller for Grow Tent, which I was using for a laser exhaust unit, addressed the airflow issue. [VIVOSUN R4](https://amzn.to/4bKNpdq). For filtration, I added [Merv 13 Material for Air Filters](https://amzn.to/3DtchtM), cut to cover the end of my [VIVOSUN 4-Inch 25 Feet Flex Air Aluminum Duct](https://amzn.to/43HQIjD), along with the rack, the [Mushroom Strip Light Complete Set COB LED](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/mushroom-strip-light-complete-set-cob-led-16-4-ft.aspx), and heaters from the Ecosphere kit.

### CLOUDLAB Features  
- **Thick 2000D Canvas**  
  The tent is made from tear-resistant Oxford fabric with a highly reflective diamond mylar interior to maximize light efficiency. This material is amazing and tough—I have not had to replace it.  
- **Strong Steel Frame**  
  The 22mm-thick steel poles provide extra durability and can handle heavy lights and equipment.  
- **Dual Ventilation Ports**  
  Pre-cut ventilation holes make it easy to set up my exhaust fan and duct hose.  
- **Spacious Interior**  
  The 4’ x 2’ x 6’ size holds the rack just fine.  

## Starting Fresh  

If I were starting without the Ecosphere, my build would look like this. I'm not sure what to do to replace the heater that comes with the Ecosphere, but I haven't really needed it. The CLOUDLINE PRO T6 and hose drive up the cost, but I was already using them in the Ecosphere, so for me, it's not really an additional cost.
