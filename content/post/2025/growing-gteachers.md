# Growing Golden Teacher Mushrooms

Golden Teacher mushrooms have become popular among home growers thanks to their relatively easy cultivation process and distinctive golden caps. Here's how to grow these fascinating fungi at home.

## What You'll Need

Golden Teacher mushrooms require a few basic supplies to get started. You'll need a substrate (growing medium), spores or spawn, containers, and basic equipment to maintain proper growing conditions.

## Step-by-Step Growing Process

First, prepare your substrate. Many growers use a mixture of brown rice flour and vermiculite, which provides nutrients and proper moisture retention. Mix these ingredients with water, then fill small containers about two-thirds full.

Next, sterilize your substrate. This crucial step prevents unwanted mold and bacteria from competing with your mushrooms. You can use a pressure cooker or steam bath for this process.

After cooling, add your Golden Teacher spores or spawn to the substrate. This is called inoculation. Remember to work in a clean environment to avoid contamination.

Place your containers in a warm, dark spot. The ideal temperature is around 75-80°F (24-27°C). During this colonization phase, white, thread-like mycelium will spread throughout the substrate.

Once fully colonized (usually takes 2-4 weeks), move your containers to a cooler location with indirect light. This triggers the fruiting phase. Maintain high humidity by misting regularly or using a humidity tent.

Small mushroom pins will form and develop into mature Golden Teachers within 1-2 weeks. They're ready to harvest when the caps open and the veils beneath them begin to tear.

## Helpful Tips

Stay patient! Mushroom growing requires time and careful attention to conditions. Contamination is the biggest challenge for beginners, so keep everything clean.

Maintain proper humidity without making things too wet. Excessive moisture can lead to mold problems.

Keep a growing journal to track your progress and learn from each grow cycle. What works best can vary based on your specific environment.

## Harvesting and Storage

Harvest your Golden Teachers by gently twisting and pulling them from the substrate. Store them in paper bags in the refrigerator if you won't use them immediately, or dry them for longer storage.

With proper care and a bit of patience, you'll enjoy watching these golden-capped mushrooms emerge and grow. Each cultivation cycle teaches valuable lessons about these fascinating organisms and the conditions they need to thrive.
