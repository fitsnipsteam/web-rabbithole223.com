### Failed Lions Mane growth

I have run two flushes with the North Spore Lions Mane in a box and the first fruited and I was able to eat but I really felt it should have went longer.
The second flush is less prommising it grew but then I seemed to over wet it and it started to go yellow and got really soft, it sadly went to the trash.

### Antler Reishie Mushroom Growth

This is the mycolabs fruit in a bag and it looks amazing! Checkout out youtube for a few short videos.

### Turkey Tail Mushroom Growth

Slow starter but once I got the humidity up to 90% plus it fruiting. Seems to be a slow grower but its happening.
