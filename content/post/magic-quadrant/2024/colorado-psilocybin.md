## Overview

In November 2022, Colorado voters passed Proposition 122 [Legislative Council Draft](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/initiative%2520referendum_proposition%20122%20final%20lc%20packet.pdf), also known as the "Natural Medicine Health Act of 2022." This groundbreaking legislation decriminalizes the possession, use, and personal cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other natural psychedelic substances for individuals aged 21 and over.

## Key Aspects of the Proposition

### Decriminalization

- **Personal Use and Possession**: Proposition 122 decriminalizes the personal use and possession of certain psychedelic plants and fungi, including psilocybin, for those 21 years of age or older. This shift in policy reflects a growing interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs in treating mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and PTSD.

### Home Cultivation

- **Growing at Home**: The law also allows for the personal cultivation and sharing of these substances, including the growing of psychedelic mushrooms. However, it's crucial to note that while cultivation and use are decriminalized, the sale of these substances remains illegal under this new legislation.

## Implementation and Future Steps

### Healing Centers

- **Supervised Use**: The law establishes "healing centers" where individuals can use substances like psilocybin and psilocin in a supervised setting. These centers are expected to start operating by late 2024, with strict guidelines and oversight to ensure safety and efficacy in use.

### Advisory Board

- **Regulation and Oversight**: A "Natural Medicine Advisory Board" will be appointed to oversee the process, ensuring proper training and qualification of facilitators at these centers. This board will play a crucial role in shaping the future of psychedelic use and therapy in Colorado.
