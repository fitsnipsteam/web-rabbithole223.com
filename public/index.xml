      <description>General Questions Are you being paid by any of the companies that you have reviewed products for No, as of 2024-01-11 I have not been paid one penny and I have purchased all my products. If that every changes I will be sure to state that in future reviews.
Why do you use Midwest Grow Kits so much Is actually a matter of them accepting bitcoin at this time. Sadly North Spores crypto payments seem to be offline as of Jan 08, 2024 so its harder for me to justify using them.</description>

      <description>Introduction The 48-Quart Monotub from Myco Labs was my first monotub. This kit is nice, but I do have a few concerns.
Ordering and Assembly Ordered from Amazon, and it arrived promptly as usual. When it arrived, I had a look and was faced with a decision: to put the plugs in or the filters over the holes. Since I was using a North Spore Organic Lion&amp;rsquo;s Mane Mushroom Spray &amp;amp; Grow Kit, which was already starting to fruit, and I just needed to control moisture levels, I chose to use half the plugs and leave the other holes open, considering that while fruiting, there is not as much risk of contamination.</description>

      <description>Failed Lions Mane growth I have run two flushes with the North Spore Lions Mane in a box and the first fruited and I was able to eat but I really felt it should have went longer. The second flush is less prommising it grew but then I seemed to over wet it and it started to go yellow and got really soft, it sadly went to the trash.
