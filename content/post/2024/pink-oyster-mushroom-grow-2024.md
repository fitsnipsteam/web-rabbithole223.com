* 2024-03-01 Update with [Midwest Grow Kits](https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/) Affilate links. 

I had Turkey Tail, Antler Reishi, Shiitake, Pioppino, and King Trumpet Oysters growing so I was trying to stall the Pink Oysters I had from MyCo Labs. Saddly they started to fruit in the bag in the dark, so I was left with no choice but to get them moving.



## Introduction

As stated in my other 2024 grow articles I purchased four of the [Mystery Kit Specials](https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/ReadyGrow) from Midwest Grow Kits, my favorite Bitcoin-accepting vendor! Whad I didnt share is I really wanted to grow Pink Oysters and to make sure I received that I also ordered a one box that was not a mystery. 

From Midwest Grow Kits site:

***"Mystery Kit - Our Choice: Save 25%-35% discount off regular price! We choose from our inventory! This Mystery Kit is the same quality as our retail. You may even get one of our small batch rare varieties that we sell only in our retail store or even an upcoming variety that we are still testing and may be available soon. If you order multiple mystery kits, we do try and give you a variety, but there are no returns or exchanges on mystery kit orders. Some recent examples are: Enoki, Bear's Head, ABM Mushroom, Elm Oyster, Nameko, and soon the Abalone Mushroom!"***

My shipment included the Lion's Mane, Pioppino, King Trumpet, and of course the Shiitake mushroom grow kits. These kits arrived a week before Christmas, a busy time in my house, so I didn't open them until the first week of January. When I did, a few of them had a note that the blocks are new and I should let them sit for 2 weeks. It had been a few weeks already, but looking at them, I didn't feel they had enough mycelium growth, so I threw them back in the closet, but I didn't close the door. I think this is why the Shiitake and Pioppino started to grow. The Shiitake block was still white and not yet the dark brown that most of them I see on the internet are, maybe I started them too soon.

Anyway, I threw them into my [Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0](https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/Ecosphere) tent. 

I will update this article as the grow moves forward.
