First thing I learned was that I migh have started the block to soon! The color was not a deep brown as I have read is the suggested color of the brick before starting fruiting. 

## Introduction

Shiitake mushrooms, or Lentinula edodes, are a flavorful and nutritious edible mushroom from East Asia. Known for their savory taste and meaty texture, they are a popular choice in various cuisines.

Nutritional Benefits: Shiitakes are low in calories but rich in B-vitamins and minerals like zinc and iron.

Medicinal Properties: They contain beneficial compounds like polysaccharides and lentinan, which boost the immune system and are even used in some cancer treatments.

Heart Health and Cholesterol: Shiitakes have been found to lower cholesterol levels and improve heart health.

Immune System Support: Their polysaccharides, particularly beta-glucans, enhance the immune system.

Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory: They are high in antioxidants and possess anti-inflammatory properties, beneficial for reducing chronic disease risks and alleviating inflammation-related conditions.

Culinary Versatility: Shiitake mushrooms are versatile in cooking, used in soups, stir-fries, and as meat substitutes in vegetarian dishes.

My personal motivation for choosing to grow shiitake mushrooms stemmed from a desire to embark on a new learning journey. The concept of growing mushrooms appeared a intriguing and enjoyable past time. As a mushroom eating enthusiast, the prospect of cultivating and savoring various varieties at home was particularly appealing. 


## Day 0 - yea I am a computer guy

I purchased four of the [Mystery Kit Specials](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/ready-to-grow-gourmet-mushroom-kit-5lbs-your-choice.aspx) from Midwest Grow Kits my favort bitcoin accepting vendor! 

*Mystery Kit - Our Choice: Save 25%-35% discount off regular price!  We choose from our inventory! This Mystery Kit is the same quality as our retail. You may even get one of our small batch rare varieties that we sell only in our retail store or even an upcoming variety that we are still testing and may be available soon. If you order multiple mystery kits we do try and give you a variety but there are no returns or exchanges on mystery kit orders. Some recent examples are:   Enoki, Bears Head, ABM Mushroom, Elm Oyster, Nameko and soon the Abalone Mushroom! 

My shipment included that Lions Mane, Pioppino, King Trumpet, and ofcourse the Shiitake mushroom grow kits. These kits arived a week before Christmas, a buy time in my house so I didnt open them until the first week of January. When I did a few of them had a note that the blocks are new and I should let them site for 2 weeks. It had been a few weeks already but looking at them I didnt feel they had enough myceilum growth so I threw them back in the closet but I didnt close the door, I think this is why the Shiitake and Pioppion started to grow. The Shiitake block was still white and not yet the dark brown that most of them I see on the internet are, maybe I started them too soon.

Anyway I threw them on my [The Mushroom Humidity Dome](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/the-mushroom-humidity-dome.aspx) tray, put in about a half inch of water, and put the whole thing into my [Mushroom Ecosphere 3.0](https://www.midwestgrowkits.com/the-mushroom-ecosphere-3-0.aspx) tent. 

I will update this article as the grow moves forward
