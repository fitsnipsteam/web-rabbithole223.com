### Yield: Four to six servings

Hey everyone! Today, we're diving into a fantastic cooking journey. We're turning Pink Oyster mushrooms into an amazing 'bacon' that's not just easy to make, but also incredibly delicious. Trust me, your taste buds are in for a treat!

### Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons butter (or vegan butter substitute)
- 3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 12 oz Pink Oyster mushrooms, cut into bacon-sized strips

### Let's Get Cooking

#### Step 1: Setting the Stage

Alright, first up, let's get that oven heated to 350°F (175°C). We're looking for a perfect balance of heat here to get our mushrooms just right.

#### Step 2: Prepping Your Mushrooms

Now, let's tackle those mushrooms. Trim off the tough stems – we want only the best parts. I prefer cutting them a bit larger than usual for ease of handling and a better bite.

#### Step 3: The Flavor Symphony

Over to the stove, we melt the butter on low heat. Then in goes the maple syrup, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Let's keep it mellow and just let the flavors gently blend together.

#### Step 4: Preparing for Perfection

Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This little trick is a lifesaver for easy cleanup and perfect cooking.

#### Step 5: The Mushroom Makeover

It's time to coat those mushrooms. Toss them in the bowl with our maple-butter mix until they're all evenly covered. This is where the flavor magic happens!

#### Step 6: The Transformation

Spread them out on the baking sheet. We're not overcrowding them – each one deserves its own space to crisp up. Into the oven for about 15-20 minutes, giving them a flip halfway through. I found the sweet spot at 13 minutes, then flipped for another 4.

#### Step 7: The Finale

And there you have it! Once they're golden and crispy, take them out and let them cool down a bit. They crisp up even more as they cool.

### Serving Suggestion

Your Pink Oyster Mushroom Maple "Bacon" is all set to jazz up your breakfast, sandwiches, or salads. It's a game-changer in the kitchen and a real crowd-pleaser. Enjoy the magic of cooking with this simple yet stunning dish!
