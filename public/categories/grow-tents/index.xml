      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;goodbye-ecosphere-30&#34;&gt;Goodbye Ecosphere 3.0&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about indoor growing, picking the right grow tent system is key to creating a controlled and efficient environment.  I started with the Ecosphere 3.0 from Midwest Grow Kit and it seemed good but over time it became clear it a was not a good fit. The plastic cover was very fragile and I was it separated at were the zipper connected to the plastic. On the third time replacing the cover I was fed up. The wire racks also turned out to be flimsy and a pain to deal with with the fragile plastic grow tent cover of the Ecosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
