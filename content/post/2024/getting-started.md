Starting your journey into mushroom cultivation can be both exciting and cost-effective. Whether you're a hobbyist looking to grow a few mushrooms for personal use or someone aiming to dive into a more serious cultivation setup, understanding the initial investment is crucial. Here, we'll break down the costs and provide insights into what you can expect when setting up your own mushroom growing operation.

## Getting Started with a Grow Kit

For those who are new to mushroom growing, a grow kit is a fantastic way to start. These kits are user-friendly and come with everything you need to grow your first batch of mushrooms. Prices for grow kits typically start at around $30. You can find reliable kits [here](https://midwestgrowkits.referralrock.com/l/RABBITHOLE22/SimpleKit).

## Upgrading to a Monotub

Once you've had some success with a grow kit, you might want to step up your game. A monotub is an excellent next step, especially for growing varieties like lion's mane and shiitake mushrooms. You can build a simple monotub for less than $50. It's recommended to use large tubs as lion's mane needs space to spread out.
