## Why I Started Looking Into This

So I got a message from a guy on our YouTube channel a while back asking if growing and consuming Reishi mushrooms would tank his testosterone. He was genuinely worried. He'd read some stuff online, saw a few scary Reddit threads, and was ready to throw out his Reishi blocks entirely. That bugged me because I've been growing Reishi on and off since early 2024 and I take the powder semi-regularly. I wrote an article about [Reishi and hormonal balance](/post/2024/anti-androgenic-reishi/) back then but I wanted to go deeper this time. Specifically on testosterone.

I spent a few weeks going through studies, reading papers I probably shouldn't have tried to read without a biology degree, and talking to a couple people who know more about this than I do. Here's what I came away with.

## The Short Answer

Reishi probably doesn't lower your testosterone levels directly. What it does appear to do is mess with how your body converts testosterone into something called DHT, which is dihydrotestosterone. DHT is basically a stronger version of testosterone and its involved in things like prostate growth, hair loss, and a bunch of other androgen-related stuff.

The key enzyme here is called 5-alpha reductase. This is the thing that takes your testosterone and turns it into DHT. A study from 2005 that gets referenced constantly looked at 19 different species of mushrooms and tested their ability to inhibit 5-alpha reductase. Reishi came out on top, inhibiting the enzyme somewhere between 70-80%. Thats a pretty significant number.

But heres the thing that a lot of the clickbait articles leave out: inhibiting 5-alpha reductase is not the same thing as lowering testosterone. Your body still produces testosterone at the same rate. Whats changing is what happens to it downstream.

## What the Actual Studies Show

Lets break this down because the research is honestly kind of all over the place.

**The human study everyone cites:** 88 men with urinary tract symptoms took either Reishi extract (6mg daily) or a placebo for twelve weeks. The Reishi group showed improved prostate symptom scores. Their testosterone levels? Unchanged. This is the only real human trial I could find that directly measured testosterone alongside Reishi supplementation and it showed no effect on T levels.

**The mouse studies that scare people:** Some animal studies using doses of 100-300mg/kg showed reduced testosterone in rodents. Thats a meaningful dose relative to body weight and mice metabolize things very differently than we do. I'm not saying ignore it, but I am saying that extrapolating mouse doses to human outcomes is exactly the kind of thing that leads to panicked Reddit posts.

**The study that says the opposite:** Theres actually research out of China showing that Reishi extract increased testosterone by about 25% in middle-aged mice and more than doubled their mating behavior. Same mushroom, different result. The mice on Reishi also produced about 37% more offspring. So which is it? Honestly, it depends on the extract type, the dose, and probably a dozen other variables nobody has fully nailed down yet.

## The Extract Type Matters More Than People Think

This is the part that I think gets lost in most conversations about Reishi and hormones. Reishi mushrooms contain hundreds of bioactive compounds but the two big categories are polysaccharides and triterpenoids.

The anti-androgenic effects, the 5-alpha reductase inhibition, thats coming from the triterpenoids. And heres what matters: alcohol-based extracts (ethanolic extracts) pull out way more triterpenoids than hot water extracts. So if you're drinking Reishi tea made from fruiting bodies you grew at home, thats predominantly a water extract. You're getting mostly polysaccharides which are great for immune support but probably not hitting you with a meaningful dose of the compounds that affect DHT conversion.

If you're taking a dual-extracted tincture or an alcohol-extracted supplement, thats a different story. The concentration of triterpenoids is going to be significantly higher and thats where the hormonal effects become more relevant.

I grow Reishi at home and mostly dehydrate it and make tea or powder. Based on what I've read I don't think my method of consumption is delivering enough triterpenoids to meaningfully affect my hormone levels. But I'm not a doctor and I haven't had my levels tested before and after, so take that for what its worth.

## The Cortisol Connection

One thing that gets overlooked is the stress angle. Reishi is well known as an adaptogen, it helps your body manage stress and has been shown to lower cortisol levels. Why does this matter for testosterone? Because cortisol and testosterone have an inverse relationship. When cortisol goes up, testosterone tends to go down. Chronic stress is one of the most common reasons men have lower than expected testosterone.

So theres an argument to be made that by reducing cortisol, Reishi could actually help maintain healthier testosterone levels indirectly. I find this more interesting than the 5-alpha reductase stuff honestly, because stress management is something most of us are terrible at and its quietly wrecking our hormones without us even realizing it.

## My Take

Look, I've been growing Reishi since 2024. I still grow it. I still consume it. Am I worried about my testosterone? Not really, and heres why:

1. The only human study that measured testosterone showed no change
2. The anti-androgenic effects are primarily about DHT conversion, not testosterone production
3. The extract type and dose matter enormously and most home growers aren't consuming pharmaceutical-grade ethanol extracts
4. The cortisol-lowering benefits might actually help testosterone indirectly

That said, if you're someone dealing with hormonal issues already, or you're on TRT, or you have a condition that makes you sensitive to androgen changes, talk to your doctor before supplementing with Reishi. Thats not me being overly cautious, thats just common sense. Especially if you're taking a concentrated supplement rather than just brewing tea from your home grow.

For the average home grower who's enjoying their Reishi harvest and maybe making some tea or adding powder to smoothies? I wouldn't lose sleep over it.
